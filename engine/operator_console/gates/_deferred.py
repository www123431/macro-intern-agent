"""Stub modules for Gates 4 / 7 / 8 — DEFERRED to Phase 2 polish.

Each returns a GateResult with status=DEFERRED so the framework keeps
the full 8-gate skeleton visible to the UI + audit trail. When a gate
ships for real, replace its stub with the real check module and update
the registry.

Why a single file instead of 3 modules:
  - Each stub is 5 lines; separate modules would be 3×30-line files
    of boilerplate
  - Real gate implementations get their own module (see gate1, 2, 3, 5, 6)
  - This file's expected lifetime is short — every entry here is a
    promise to ship the real check later

Shipped from this stub file:
  - gate2_cost_robust (2026-06-28) → engine/operator_console/gates/gate2_cost_robust.py
